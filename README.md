# PowerShell Security Monitoring Scripts

## Overview
This repository, maintained by Trond Hoiberg, contains a collection of PowerShell scripts designed for cybersecurity monitoring and analysis. In addition some scripts that can be useful in my daily work. 
As a cybersecurity engineer at a large organization, I develop these tools to monitor PowerShell usage, detect potential misuse, and identify malicious activities by adversaries that may evade Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions. The scripts focus on analyzing Event Logs, PowerShell Transcript files, and other relevant data sources to enhance security visibility.

## Purpose
The primary objective of these scripts is to provide robust monitoring and analysis capabilities for PowerShell activities within an enterprise environment. By leveraging PowerShell's native capabilities, these tools help identify suspicious behavior, unauthorized access, or malicious scripts that could indicate a security breach.

## Features
- **Event Log Analysis**: Scripts to parse and analyze Windows Event Logs for PowerShell-related activities, identifying anomalies or suspicious patterns.
- **Transcript File Monitoring**: Tools to examine PowerShell Transcript files for evidence of misuse or malicious commands.
- **Custom Detection Logic**: Implement tailored detection rules to catch activities that may bypass traditional EDR solutions.
- **Scalable and Modular**: Designed to be adaptable for various environments and easily extensible for additional use cases.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- PowerShell 5.1 or later (Windows PowerShell or PowerShell Core).
- Administrative privileges to access Event Logs and Transcript files.
- Basic understanding of PowerShell scripting and Windows security concepts.

### Usage
- Each script includes detailed comments and usage instructions within the code.
- Refer to individual script documentation for specific parameters and outputs.
